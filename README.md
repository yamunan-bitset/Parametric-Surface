# Parametric Surface Visualiser
## What is a Function Parametrisation?
A Parametric Function is one that maps an `n` dimensional object to `m` dimensions. That is:
```f: R^n -> R^m```


## What is a Surface Parametrisaion?
This is a specific case where `n = 2` and `m = 3`. Or in other words a 2D object is plotted onto 3D space. this can be very well visualised as the stretching, folding and beding of a 2D plane and mapping a 3D object.

## What about this Tool?
Run the file `gui.py`
Here you can define your function and visualise it accordingly.
